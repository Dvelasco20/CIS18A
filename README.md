Description:
The provided code represents a simple sushi ordering system implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. Here's an overview of its functionality and structure:

1. **What the Program Does**: It's like a digital menu for ordering sushi and related items.

2. **How You Use It**:
   - First, it asks for your name, the day you want to pick up your order, and the time you'll come.
   - Then, it shows you a menu with different items: sushi, bento box, salad, and milk tea.
   - You pick what you want from the menu.
   - For each item, it asks if you want any extras, like avocado or chicken.
   - When you're done ordering, you click "Checkout" to finish.
   
3. **Behind the Scenes**:
   - It keeps track of what you order and how much it costs.
   - It writes down your order, name, pickup day, and time in a file called "checkout_list.txt".

4. **If Something Goes Wrong**:
   - If you type something wrong, it will tell you and ask you to try again.

In simple terms, it's like ordering food online. You pick what you want, add any extras, and then check out. The program makes sure everything is written down correctly.
